## 🧠 Overview

**JTB BatchAttEdit** is a specialized utility for AutoCAD users who need fast and reliable control over block attributes across multiple drawings. It removes the need for repetitive manual edits by allowing attribute data to be managed in bulk from a single interface.

The application presents attributes in a flexible, table-based view where columns can be shown or hidden as needed. This makes it easy to focus only on relevant data fields, improving clarity when working with complex or information-rich drawings.

Designed for Windows environments, JTB BatchAttEdit integrates smoothly into professional CAD workflows. It is particularly useful for architects, engineers, and drafters who require consistent attribute data throughout large projects.
